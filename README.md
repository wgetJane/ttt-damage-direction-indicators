## gmod damage direction indicators

removes the annoying red flashbang effect that you see when you take damage and replaces it with tf2-like damage direction indicators

the horizontal direction of the damage is shown by the position of the indicator around the crosshair (above means it came from in front, below means it came from behind)

the amount of damage you took is shown by the width of the indicator (max width = 100 damage)

the vertical direction is shown by the length of the indicator (longer means it came from above, shorter means it came from below)

the distance of the source of the damage is shown by the distance between the indicator and the crosshair (closer to crosshair means the source is nearer)

this was made for ttt, but it should still work on other gamemodes

use this client cvar to toggle it on or off `ttt_dmgdirect_indicators 1`
